# GRADE: 96/96 

## Demo - 6/6 points
* 4/4 Each new feature was justified and demonstrated.
* 1/1 An original composition was played.
* 1/1 All team members were included.

## Original composition - 6/6 points
* 3/3 The composition demonstrates the features of your software.
* 3/3 The composition is artistic.

## User manual - 10/10 points
* 2/2 There is a file named manual.md in the top-level directory.
* 4/4 It describes each new feature added in Project 9.
* 4/4 It explains how to use each new feature.

## Ambition - 16/16 points
* There are several new features. 
* Changing the background color is easy.
* Drag-and-draw notes is a straightforward feature, but also a unique one.
* Adding a default note duration is straightforward. (Several groups did this.)
* Displaying note properties in the left sidebar is fairly straightforward as well. 
* Beats are algorithmically straightforward and use existing facilities for programmatically adding notes to a composition.
* Adding right-click context menus required you to learn something new.
* Pausing and scrubbing is a somewhat complex feature which also required you to learn new things. It would be nicer if you could actually drag the red line, in addition to using the keyboard. 

## Execution -  38/38 points

### Implementation of new features - 24/24 points
* All new features behave as described in the user manual.  If the description in the user manual is incomplete, then the behavior follows standard conventions and is otherwise unsurprising.
* There are no uncaught exceptions from new features.
* There is no debugging output from new features.

### No regressions - 12/12 points
* All prior requirements are met, unless they have been superseded by new requirements or are documented by the team as known bugs for this iteration.

### Release tag - 2/2 points
* The release is tagged as project8-release.

## Reflection and elegance - 20/20 points

* 4/4 UML diagram is accurate and complete.
* 2/2 Design overview addresses changes from Project 8 in general.
* 4/4 Design overview addresses implementation of each new feature.
* 4/4 Assessment of what is elegant and what is not thoughtfully addresses object-oriented design principles.
* 2/2 Velocity is presented. 
* 1/1 Team retrospective is presented.
* 3/3 New classes/methods are reasonably self-explanatory.
