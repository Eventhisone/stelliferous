Stelliferous Project 9 Manual
=============================

New Special Features
------------------

**Change the Instrument**
Right-click on a single notes, multiple notes, or gestures and select "Change Instrument." All notes will change to the
currently selected instrument!

**Group, Ungroup, Cut, and Copy Directly**
Rather than using menu-items, you can right-click on notes directly and use a pop-up menu to cut, copy, or group selected
notes/groups as well as ungroup a single selected gesture.

**Paste In Place**
Rather than simply copying and pasting directly to the right of the cut/copied notes, you can now paste notes and gestures
anywhere on screen! With something on the clipboard, simply right click on the composition pane and click 'paste.'

**Default Note Duration**
Tired of the same-old, same-old 100px notes? Use the Note Duration slider above the instrument pane to change the default
duration of notes (they can be as short as 5px or as long as 200px).

**Beats**
If you'd like a drone or beat underlying your composition, the "Beats" menu is efficient way to add just that. Just choose
any of the premade options from the "Beats" menu, and you can have a pattern of notes added to your composition. Some of them
make use of trigonometric functions to debut new and interesting sounds.

Finally, you can click "Save As Beat" to 'save' your selected notes as a beat. Choosing "add saved beat" will paste all of those notes back into your composition in a single 
gesture (this is also a great shortcut to cleaning up messy gesture families).

**'Scrubbing' the Composition**
In addition to simply playing and stopping the composiition, you can use the JKL keys to pause it and start playing from any
time. Using the "K" key will pause or unpause the composition. Using the "J" key will pause it and move the red line (and play
time) backwards. Using the "L" key will pause the composition and move the red line (and play time) forward.

**Properties**
When clicking on a note, look to the left pane to find out the details behind it. The "Properties" dialoge includes information 
on a selected note's instrument, width, x-position, y-position, and how many groups you've selected.

**Background Color**
Use the color picker in the left pane to change the background color!

Other Features
--------------

**Drag and Draw Notes**
Rather than just clicking on the composition pane, hold down shift and drag to add a path of notes to the composition.

**Mark State & Revert to Mark State**
Instead of hitting 'undo' or 'redo' many times over, consider directly saving the current state of your composition. With 
"Mark State," you can give a name to the current state of this Composition. By choosing "Revert to Marked State" and entering 
that same name, you can revert to that previous state.

**Ungroup All**
Instead of going through each group and selecting "ungroup," you can ungroup all notes in one click by selecting the "Ungroup
All" menu item under Edit.
